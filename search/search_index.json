It has one overall theme: that games are really about learning. Learning is the core of it all. He supports his argument poorly, in my opinion. The worst part is when he makes a call to action that games are about reinforcing evolutionarily important survival skills. He cites: * Marathons House: teaches social status Gambling games: teach us about odds Mancala: sharing seeds Among others. I think his case is that games are an essential part of being human, and fun is why we like learning, why we evolved past sharks. The issue is that reducing games to such abstract elements as: force projection, spatial understanding, territory, hunting, aiming, timing, you lose what makes modern games compelling. They might have those central mechanical themes, but they are about more than that when we consider the other artistic expressions in games. Koster also completely discounts narrative. He says it's a side dish that can be ignored for the most part. Makes sense since he hasn't made a good game in a long time. Around page 114 we get to actual, practical game advice. Player Optimality and Predictability \u00b6 Koster makes the same argument that Tynan does. Essentially Koster says that players will try to make the game as predictable as possible and remove the fun of learning. If the game is 100% predictable, then it cannot engage learning anymore, so fun dies. I prefer Tynan's reasoning on this, but I think the results are the same. Players will try to optimize fun out of the game, our job is to make that as hard as possible. This also explains why competitive games are so successful. Ludemes \u00b6 This is a term coined by Ben Cousins to describe the basic units of gameplay. There are many, lots undiscovered we hope. Some examples are: visit everywhere, get to the other side. Good Games \u00b6 Koster says successful games incorporate the following elements: Preparation \u00b6 Before taking on a given challenge, the player gets to make some choices that affect the odds of success. Prior moves count because almost all games are multisequence.

As designers, we don't actually design decisions. We design systems that generate decisions. Something doesn't have to happen to generate emotions. The player need only sense the possibility of it happening. \u00b6 Players unconscious will process all possible events all the time. It is not enough for a designer to think about what the player will do and how the game will respond. We also have to think about what the player will consider doing, and what he'll think the game will do in response. Predictability \u00b6 It's usually an insult to say a game is predictable, but it shouldn't be, because Predictability is essential to meaningful decision making. When we want a decision to be meaningful, its outcomes must be neither unknowable nor inevitable. They must be partially predictable. \u00b6 There is a line to walk between Predictability and complete unknowability. Prediction of a possible future depends on it being driven by a consistent, comprehensible future. \u00b6 Information \u00b6 Designers can transform the process of decision making by adding or subtracting information. Tynan calls it Information balancing. Information Balancing is the design process of providing or denying information to the player to make a decision comprehensible without being obvious. \u00b6 This is an elegant method of game design because it doesn't require changing the mechanics themselves. The game stays the same. All were doing is hiding or revealing different parts of it, which is usually quicker and easier than reworking how the systems actually work. This can go wrong with too much or too little info. Tynan discusses how information starvation is harder to see than glut because designers know the game so well. He offers some solutions as well as a pitch to make some of the game state unknowable. Fictional Ambiguity \u00b6 Information from the fiction is often ambiguous because the player can't know which aspects of the fiction are real game mechanics and which are not. \u00b6 This is everywhere. Can I eat that turkey? Will this wooden wall block bullets? Tarkov has this problem especially bad in it's loot. He cites two good case studies on page 136. Good game decisions, including good puzzles, are always based around nonobvious uses of mechanics that work in obvious ways. \u00b6 He cites super Mario jumping puzzles as a great example of this.

Tynan cites the game of checkers. It has countless variations: long struggles, quick jabs. All of this is possible from a few minutes of rules explaining before the first game. It's worth reading Mechanics or Engines of Experience before going forward. Emergence is when simple mechanics interact to create complex solutions \u00b6 Leveraging emergence means crafting mechanics that don't just add together, but multiple into a rich universe of possibility \u00b6 Elegance happens when mechanics interact in complex, nonobvious ways. But this same complexity and nonobviousness makes elegant design very difficult to achieve \u00b6 We want to make more play experiences while limiting the knowledge burden on the player. Can we leverage more experience out of already existing mechanics? Elegance is hard to test. Designers have to intuit elegant mechanics \u00b6 Tynan brings up invertible matrices and how the only way to know is to actually perform the inversion. However this is time consuming. You can, with experience, \"smell\" invertible matrices. We must do the same for elegant design Below are some of the smells. Mechanics that interact with a lot of other mechanics smell like elegance \u00b6 Do a quick count of the number of interactions of the proposed mechanic. Simple Mechanics smell like elegance. \u00b6 This really talks about overburdening player knowledge. If we can write the mechanic on a cocktail napkin, it smells like elegance. We want to make sure there's not an excessive burden to learning. Mechanics that can be used in multiple ways smell like elegance. \u00b6 A tool that can be used creatively, offensively, defensively, tactically, and strategically is more elegant than one that fills a single role. Resident Evil is a good example. Guns are both offensive and defensive and offer compelling tradeoffs. If you shoot to slow, you aren't killing, but if you shoot to kill, you risk more zombies coming and getting you. Mechanics that don't overlap in their roles are also elegant. \u00b6 The most elegant mechanics are so distinct in their role that they open up completely new kinds of play. Don't create variations on existing interactions. Instead, seek mechanics that introduce new strategies and avenues of exploration that didn't exist in any form before. Mechanics that reuse estabilished conventions and interfaces smell like elegance because they leverage knowledge that players already have. \u00b6 Mechanics that work on a similar scale to other mechanics smells like elegance. \u00b6 This is tricky. His example is a game where you play as a first person shooter, then in other sections you're in a jet. The jet sequences make all other mechanics in the game kind of meaningless. What does it matter if an enemy on foot can move left or right if you have a 1000 pound bomb in a jet? That said, there are some counterexamples in modern gaming that aren't noted. Nier: Automata is one. Mechanics that are reused a lot smell like elegance \u00b6 Tynan says repetition of mechanics is essential to elegant design. A mechanic that's used once is a gimmick. There's a one to one relationship between cost and payoff. A mechanic that's used 100,000 times can potentially be very elegant, if it can generate new experiences every time. Mechanics that don't impose restrictions on content smell like elegance. \u00b6 This is tricky since the problem is endemic. Tynan makes this case: A detective game that has a chase sequence. The chase sequence doesn't test well. Designers put rocket boots on him and he can now jump 20 feet. Chase feels better, win win. However, this now makes the rest of the game's content have to conform to that mechanic. And it makes the game nonsensical. You want mechanics that will work well for the problem at hand without hurting the rest of the game's content. Mechanics that use the full expressiveness of the available interface smell like elegance. \u00b6 We can measure angles of joysticks, angles of depression on triggers. We should leverage that.","title":"Mechanical Elegance"},{"location":"Designing%20Games/Elegance/Elegance/#mechanical-elegance","text":"Elegance in games stems from emergence.

A deep game has enough nuance and variation to provide new lessons for a long time. Ironically, players will try their hardest to solve the game, and they will hate the designer if they succeed. A game's skill ceiling is the level of skill beyond which there is no way to improve performance. If this skill level is beyond the abilities of human beings, the game is limitlessly deep and can never be fully solved by anyone. \u00b6 Accessibility \u00b6 Accessible games create meaningful play at low skill levels. A game's skill barrier is the lower limit of skill below which it is unplayable. \u00b6 Designers often overlook accessibility because we're so proficient. We should not. Skill Range \u00b6 A game's skill range is the range of skill levels at which a game presents a meaningful challenge. \u00b6 This means that a game can be enjoyed by novices and experts alike. Reinvention \u00b6 Tynan talks a lot about how games with good skill ranges and elegant mechanics often reinvent themselves. His example is UT4. At first, it's aiming. Then, it's map knowledge. Then, it's tracking and weapon knowledge. Finally, it's psychological. Once the mechanics are learned, the other skillsets mastered, it becomes a psychological game about outplaying your opponent who is, we hope, of equal skill level. Games broaden their skill range by repeatedly reinventing themselves as the player's skill increases. \u00b6 Games tend to go through three characteristic reinventions along their skill range: the MANUAL, the SITUATIONAL, and the MENTAL. \u00b6 Manual \u00b6 This is about simple, moment to moment mechanical skills. In a shooter, it's drawing a bead on a target. In tetris, its about getting pieces to fall where you want them. Situational \u00b6 The situational reinvention is the second level. This is where manual skills are mostly unconscious. In a fighting game, a player can execute multibutton combo-strikes at will. This is the level where most players are, and where most games are designed to function. It comprises situational awareness, reading patterns, knowing counterstrategies, and many other midlevel game skills. This is probably the broadest level. Mental \u00b6 The mental level is often not reached. Mental skills are all about maintaining concentration and performance. Elastic Challenges \u00b6 Start with a thought experiment. What if darts was only the bullseye? It wouldn't matter what size the bullseye was, it would either be too easy or too hard for some players, maybe most players. Darts solves this by having concentric rings and other areas that provide a score. This allows players of lower skill to enjoy the game and still have some level of success. This is an elastic challenge . Elastic Challenges permit different degrees of success and failure to provide appropriate challenges to players across a wider skill gap \u00b6 this is important to remember. As important: Just as we can present different degrees of success, we can present different degrees of failure. \u00b6 Training \u00b6 Good training is invisible. \u00b6 Tynan calls out the CoD4 training sequence as a great example. Let's break it down here as a case study. It is a tutorial sequence with a fiction layer of a training course. It works narratively AND tutorially. However, there's more. Within this training sequence, there are elastic challenges that help the game decide what difficulty you belong on. The training course is also a time trial , and the faster you complete it with a better score, the harder the game can be for you. It succeeds on multiple levels from a design pov. Emotional life support. Even though the player may be in the training phase or in the tutorial phase, they will still struggle with skill and mechanic checks. We can sustain them through this period with emotional triggers to help move them along. \u00b6 These triggers could be cool characters, cinematics, joking with friends in multiplayer. Failure \u00b6 Tynan has a lot of words about failure here, but it can really be summarized as: Don't punish the player for failure, punish the player character. \u00b6 He cites having the player have to redo load screens, rekill enemies, grind for resources. All of these things he casts as bad. Obviously, there's nuance here and we're getting an opinionated take. he also says beware the failure trap, where regardless of what the player does, they will fail. Seems obvious.","title":"Skill"},{"location":"Designing%20Games/Elegance/Skill/#depth","text":"","title":"Depth"},{"location":"Designing%20Games/Elegance/Skill/#deep-games-create-meaningful-play-at-high-skill-levels","text":"The idea of depth describes how much there is to learn about a game.

IMMERSION is when the mental division between the player's real self and his in-game avatar softens, so events happening to the avatar ecome meaningful as though they were happening to player himself. Everyone agrees immersion is valuable, but there is little agreement on where it comes from. Silent protagonists, graphical fidelity, lowering the lights in the room have been called out as contributors. But there are games with all of these things that are not immersive, and immersive games that have none of these things. Immersion occurs when the player's experience mirrors the character's experience. The best way to describe immersion itself is as the player's experience mirroring the character's experience. Obviously this means the player hears and sees the same things as the character. More importantly, it means the player thinks and feels the same things as the character. This internal psychological mirroring is the missing piece in most failed attempts at immersion. How do we create it? The Two-Factor Theory of Emotion \u00b6 The two-factor theory of emotion says that emotions are composed of two parts: physiological arousal and a cognitive label. Arousal is the state of being amped up and ready to act. Fear, anger, sexual tension are all arousal. This theory says that all of those different intense emotions are physiologically the same. According to the theory, the only difference between these feelings is the cognitive label we put on them. A cognitive label is a conscious mental explanation for what is causing the arousal state. Depending on what seems to be happening, your brain will relabel the arousal state as any of a wide variety of intense emotions. This leads to tynan's big thesis. To create an experience that mirrors that of a character, we construct it out of three parts. First, we create Flow to strip the real world out of the player's mind.

The A button makes Mario jump is a mechanic. So are the rules characters walk at one meter per second, pawns capture diagonally, and players alternate taking turns . In board games, mechanics are executed ritualistically and learned from a rule book. In video games, mechanics are written into the code. Events \u00b6 During play, mechanics and players interact to generate Events \u00b6 An event is something that happens during play. Mario hits a wall and bounces back, the pawn captures the rook, and the ball went in the net are all events. This is critical to understand. In every other medium, the events are authored directly either by the screenwriter, novelist, choreographer, etc. Games are different. We can't author the events directly, but we can author the mecahnics that generate the events we desire. Events and Mechanics Example: Super Mario Galaxy \u00b6 In Super Mario Galaxy, Mario tries to make a jump and misses, landing in lava. His butt bursts into flames and shoots him back into the air, where the player steers him toward a safe landing on the ground. The Events \u00b6 The events were Mario jumping, missing, hitting the lava, burstingi nto flames, flying into the air, screaming, and maneuvering back to safety. The Mechanics \u00b6 The mechanics behind these events were the jump button, gravity, physical collision, the explosive-butt lava reaction, and the ability to control mario in the air. The disc of SMG does not contain the events described, just the mechanics. Game Designers do not design events. We design systems of mechanics that generate events. This layer of indrection is the fundamental difference between games and most other media. It is our greatest opportunity and toughest challenge. This is also why modes of thought from other media so often fail in games. The Primacy of Emotion \u00b6 To be meaningful, an event must provoke an emotion. The valuable emotions of play are very subtle. Often, players don't directly notice them. Detecting and understanding subtle emotions is a designer skill. These three key points just focus on the fact that games are more like an EKG graph than a a straight emotive line. There are many small ups and downs that give the experience the texture needed to get players into Flow . Emotions are not limited to \"fun\" for games This seems obvious, but the goal cannot just be fun. Emotional Triggers \u00b6 Your unconscious mind is always analyzing your situation. When certain conditions are met, the unconscious triggers an emotional response. An EMOTIONAL TRIGGER is some thing or observation that causes emotion. Emotional Change \u00b6 To trigger emotion, an event must cause meaningful change in the world. But not just any change will do. To provoke an emotion, an event must change some HUMAN VALUE The defintion of this is simple. A HUMAN VALUE is a value that is important to people that can shift through multiple states The simplest example is an asteroid strike. An asteroid striking a distant planet is an astronomical curiosity. An asteroid striking the Earth is a wretched, awful event. See? Some examples of human values are: life/death, victory/defeat, friend/stranger/enemy, wealth/poverty, low status/high status, together/alone. These state changes need not be limited to only in game. Think of gambling or casino games. Whats emotional relevant is not the event itself, but the changes in human values implied by that event. The more important the human value and the more it changes, the greater the emotion. Emotions don't just happen in response to change. They also happen in anticipation of change. Consider having 9 out of 10 kills in a killstreak in MW2. A reveal of information is emotionally equivalent to change. The Emotional Black Box \u00b6 Emotion is the goal of game design, but it is a challenge,b ecause it's hard to track the precise origins of our emotions. We can't direectly perceive the logic behind our emotional triggers. Look up the 1973 bridge study. Basically, a heightened mental state of fear was misnterpreted as attraction to a woman surveyor.
