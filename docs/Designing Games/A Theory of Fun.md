This is Raph kosters book on game design.


It has one overall theme: that games are really about learning. Learning is the core of it all.


He supports his argument poorly, in my opinion.

The worst part is when he makes a call to action that games are about reinforcing evolutionarily important survival skills.

He cites:
* Marathons
House: teaches social status
Gambling games: teach us about odds
Mancala: sharing seeds 

Among others. I think his case is that games are an essential part of being human, and fun is why we like learning, why we evolved past sharks.

The issue is that reducing games to such abstract elements as: force projection, spatial understanding, territory, hunting, aiming, timing, you lose what makes modern games compelling. They might have those central mechanical themes, but they are about more than that when we consider the other artistic expressions in games.

Koster also completely discounts narrative. He says it's a side dish that can be ignored for the most part. Makes sense since he hasn't made a good game in a long time.

Around page 114 we get to actual, practical game advice.


### Player Optimality and Predictability
Koster makes the same argument that Tynan does. Essentially Koster says that players will try to make the game as predictable as possible and remove the fun of learning. If the game is 100% predictable, then it cannot engage learning anymore, so fun dies.

I prefer Tynan's reasoning on this, but I think the results are the same. Players will try to optimize fun out of the game, our job is to make that as hard as possible.

This also explains why competitive games are so successful.

### Ludemes
This is a term coined by Ben Cousins to describe the basic units of gameplay.

There are many, lots undiscovered we hope.

Some examples are: visit everywhere, get to the other side.

### Good Games

Koster says successful games incorporate the following elements:  

#### Preparation
Before taking on a given challenge, the player gets to make some choices that affect the odds of success. Prior moves count because almost all games are multisequence.

#### A Sense of Space
The space could be a landscape, chessboard, network of relationships between players during a bridge game 

#### A Solid Core Mechanic
This is a puzzle to solve. An intrinsically interesting ruleset into which
