# Mechanical Elegance
Elegance in games stems from emergence. 
Tynan cites the game of checkers. It has countless variations: long struggles, quick jabs. All of this is possible from a few minutes of rules explaining before the first game.

It's worth reading [[Mechanics]] or [[Engines of Experience]] before going forward.

#### Emergence is when simple mechanics interact to create complex solutions

#### Leveraging emergence means crafting mechanics that don't just add together, but multiple into a rich universe of possibility

#### Elegance happens when mechanics interact in complex, nonobvious ways. But this same complexity and nonobviousness makes elegant design very difficult to achieve

We want to make more play experiences while limiting the knowledge burden on the player. Can we leverage more experience out of already existing mechanics?

## Elegance is hard to test. Designers have to intuit elegant mechanics
Tynan brings up invertible matrices and how the only way to know is to actually perform the inversion. However this is time consuming. You can, with experience, "smell" invertible matrices. We must do the same for elegant design

Below are some of the smells.

#### Mechanics that interact with a lot of other mechanics smell like elegance
Do a quick count of the number of interactions of the proposed mechanic.

#### Simple Mechanics smell like elegance.
This really talks about overburdening player knowledge. If we can write the mechanic on a cocktail napkin, it smells like elegance. We want to make sure there's not an excessive burden to learning.

#### Mechanics that can be used in multiple ways smell like elegance.
A tool that can be used creatively, offensively, defensively, tactically, and strategically is more elegant than one that fills a single role.

Resident Evil is a good example. Guns are both offensive and defensive and offer compelling tradeoffs. If you shoot to slow, you aren't killing, but if you shoot to kill, you risk more zombies coming and getting you.

#### Mechanics that don't overlap in their roles are also elegant.

The most elegant mechanics are so distinct in their role that they open up completely new kinds of play. Don't create variations on existing interactions. Instead, seek mechanics that introduce new strategies and avenues of exploration that didn't exist in any form before.

#### Mechanics that reuse estabilished conventions and interfaces smell like elegance because they leverage knowledge that players already have.

#### Mechanics that work on a similar scale to other mechanics smells like elegance.
This is tricky. His example is a game where you play as a first person shooter, then in other sections you're in a jet. 

The jet sequences make all other mechanics in the game kind of meaningless. What does it matter if an enemy on foot can move left or right if you have a 1000 pound bomb in a jet?

That said, there are some counterexamples in modern gaming that aren't noted. Nier: Automata is one. 

#### Mechanics that are reused a lot smell like elegance
Tynan says repetition of mechanics is essential to elegant design. A mechanic that's used once is a gimmick. There's a one to one relationship between cost and payoff. 

A mechanic that's used 100,000 times can potentially be very elegant, if it can generate new experiences every time.

#### Mechanics that don't impose restrictions on content smell like elegance.

 This is tricky since the problem is endemic. Tynan makes this case:
 
 A detective game that has a chase sequence. The chase sequence doesn't test well. Designers put rocket boots on him and he can now jump 20 feet. Chase feels better, win win.
 
 However, this now makes the rest of the game's content have to conform to that mechanic. And it makes the game nonsensical. 
 
 You want mechanics that will work well for the problem at hand without hurting the rest of the game's content.

#### Mechanics that use the full expressiveness of the available interface smell like elegance.

We can measure angles of joysticks, angles of depression on triggers. We should leverage that.
