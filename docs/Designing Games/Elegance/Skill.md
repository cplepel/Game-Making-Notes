### Depth
#### Deep games create meaningful play at high skill levels
The idea of depth describes how much there is to learn about a game. A deep game has enough nuance and variation to provide new lessons for a long time.

Ironically, players will try their hardest to solve the game, and they will hate the designer if they succeed.

#### A game's skill ceiling is the level of skill beyond which there is no way to improve performance. If this skill level is beyond the abilities of human beings, the game is limitlessly deep and can never be fully solved by anyone.

### Accessibility
#### Accessible games create meaningful play at low skill levels. A game's skill barrier is the lower limit of skill below which it is unplayable.

Designers often overlook accessibility because we're so proficient. We should not.

### Skill Range
#### A game's skill range is the range of skill levels at which a game presents a meaningful challenge.

This means that a game can be enjoyed by novices and experts alike.

### Reinvention
Tynan talks a lot about how games with good skill ranges and elegant mechanics often reinvent themselves. His example is UT4.

At first, it's aiming.
Then, it's map knowledge.
Then, it's tracking and weapon knowledge.
Finally, it's psychological. Once the mechanics are learned, the other skillsets mastered, it becomes a psychological game about outplaying your opponent who is, we hope, of equal skill level.

#### Games broaden their skill range by repeatedly reinventing themselves as the player's skill increases.

#### Games tend to go through three characteristic reinventions along their skill range: the MANUAL, the SITUATIONAL, and the MENTAL.

##### Manual
This is about simple, moment to moment mechanical skills. In a shooter, it's drawing a bead on a target.
In tetris, its about getting pieces to fall where you want them.
##### Situational
The situational reinvention is the second level. This is where manual skills are mostly unconscious. In a fighting game, a player can execute multibutton combo-strikes at will.

This is the level where most players are, and where most games are designed to function. It comprises situational awareness, reading patterns, knowing counterstrategies, and many other midlevel game skills. 

This is probably the broadest level.

##### Mental
The mental level is often not reached. Mental skills are all about maintaining concentration and performance. 

### Elastic Challenges
Start with a thought experiment. What if darts was only the bullseye? It wouldn't matter what size the bullseye was, it would either be too easy or too hard for some players, maybe most players.

Darts solves this by having concentric rings and other areas that provide a score. This allows players of lower skill to enjoy the game and still have some level of success. This is an **elastic challenge**.

#### Elastic Challenges permit different degrees of success and failure to provide appropriate challenges to players across a wider skill gap

this is important to remember. As important:

#### Just as we can present different degrees of success, we can present different degrees of failure.

### Training

#### Good training is invisible.

Tynan calls out the CoD4 training sequence as a great example. Let's break it down here as a case study.

It is a tutorial sequence with a fiction layer of a training course. It works narratively AND tutorially. 

However, there's more. Within this training sequence, there are elastic challenges that help the game decide what difficulty you belong on. The training course is also a *time trial*, and the faster you complete it with a better score, the harder the game can be for you.

It succeeds on multiple levels from a design pov.

#### Emotional life support. Even though the player may be in the training phase or in the tutorial phase, they will still struggle with skill and mechanic checks. We can sustain them through this period with emotional triggers to help move them along.

These triggers could be cool characters, cinematics, joking with friends in multiplayer.


### Failure

Tynan has a lot of words about failure here, but it can really be summarized as:

#### Don't punish the player for failure, punish the player character.

He cites having the player have to redo load screens, rekill enemies, grind for resources. All of these things he casts as bad. Obviously, there's nuance here and we're getting an opinionated take. 

he also says beware the failure trap, where regardless of what the player does, they will fail.

Seems obvious.
