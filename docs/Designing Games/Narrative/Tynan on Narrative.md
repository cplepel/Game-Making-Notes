Game Narrative is uniquely challenging. It's a new domain that has lots of pitfalls.

Historically, especially recently, game devs have hired hollywood screenwriters to make the game. They followed three act structures.

Even the production pipeline resembled Hollywood. Prepro, production, post production.

There's one big problem though:

### While games look like films, they do not work like films.

Film can teach us a thousand ways to use the screen. Framing, composition, scene construction, visual effects, pacing, but it has nothing to say about interactivity, choice, or present tense experience.


Im cutting this section a bit short. He highlighted a lot of tools I already knew. I will add to this with more information from Game Narrative Toolbox.
