Decisions are what game design is all about.

As designers, we don't actually design decisions. We design systems that generate decisions.

#### Something doesn't have to happen to generate emotions. The player need only sense the possibility of it happening.

Players unconscious will process all possible events all the time. It is not enough for a designer to think about what the player will do and how the game will respond. We also have to think about what the player will consider doing, and what he'll think the game will do in response.

## Predictability
It's usually an insult to say a game is predictable, but it shouldn't be, because Predictability is essential to meaningful decision making.

#### When we want a decision to be meaningful, its outcomes must be neither unknowable nor inevitable. They must be partially predictable.

There is a line to walk between Predictability and complete unknowability. 

#### Prediction of a possible future depends on it being driven by a consistent, comprehensible future.


## Information

Designers can transform the process of decision making by adding or subtracting information. Tynan calls it Information balancing.

#### Information Balancing is the design process of providing or denying information to the player to make a decision comprehensible without being obvious.

This is an elegant method of game design because it doesn't require changing the mechanics themselves. The game stays the same. All were doing is hiding or revealing different parts of it, which is usually quicker and easier than reworking how the systems actually work.

This can go wrong with too much or too little info.

Tynan discusses how information starvation is harder to see than glut because designers know the game so well.

He offers some solutions as well as a pitch to make some of the game state unknowable.

## Fictional Ambiguity

#### Information from the fiction is often ambiguous because the player can't know which aspects of the fiction are real game mechanics and which are not.

This is everywhere. Can I eat that turkey? Will this wooden wall block bullets? Tarkov has this problem especially bad in it's loot.

He cites two good case studies on page 136.

#### Good game decisions, including good puzzles, are always based around nonobvious uses of mechanics that work in obvious ways.

He cites super Mario jumping puzzles as a great example of this.

An exception is when the decision lies exclusively in the fiction layer and affects only fiction.
