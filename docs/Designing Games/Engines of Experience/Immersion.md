# Immersion as an Experience
One of the most powerful game experiences is immersion.

**IMMERSION is when the mental division between the player's real self and his in-game avatar softens, so events happening to the avatar ecome meaningful as though they were happening to player himself.**

Everyone agrees immersion is valuable, but there is little agreement on where it comes from. 

Silent protagonists, graphical fidelity, lowering the lights in the room have been called out as contributors. But there are games with all of these things that are not immersive, and immersive games that have none of these things.

**Immersion occurs when the player's experience mirrors the character's experience.** 

The best way to describe immersion itself is as the player's experience mirroring the character's experience. Obviously this means the player hears and sees the same things as the character. More importantly, it means the player thinks and feels the same things as the character.

This internal psychological mirroring is the missing piece in most failed attempts at immersion. 

**How do we create it?**

### The Two-Factor Theory of Emotion

**The two-factor theory of emotion says that emotions are composed of two parts: physiological arousal and a cognitive label.**

*Arousal* is the state of being amped up and ready to act. Fear, anger, sexual tension are all arousal.

This theory says that all of those different intense emotions are physiologically the same.

**According to the theory, the only difference between these feelings is the *cognitive label* we put on them.

A cognitive label is a conscious mental explanation for what is causing the arousal state. Depending on what seems to be happening, your brain will relabel the arousal state as any of a wide variety of intense emotions. 


This leads to tynan's big thesis.

**To create an experience that mirrors that of a character, we construct it out of three parts. First, we create [[Flow]] to strip the real world out of the player's mind. Second, we create an arousal state using threats and challenges in the game mechanics. Finally, we use [[The Fiction Layer]] to label the player's arousal state to match the character's feelings.**
