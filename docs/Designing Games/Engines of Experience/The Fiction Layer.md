# [[Mechanics]] and Fiction
**[[Mechanics]] gain another layer of emotional meaning when they are wrapped in FICTION.**

## Fiction versus mechanics
**Fiction and Mechanics each create different kinds of emotions.**

Mechanics can generate tension, relief, triumph, loss, pleasure of learning, the pride of solving a puzzle. They can allow us to make friends, create bonds.

However, it's hard to do humor, awe, or immersion with mechanics alone. And without characters, the entire emotional spectrum that flows through epathhy becomes inaccesible. 

The key is we must combine fiction and mechanics to access both sides of the emotional spectrum. But there's a catch.

**Fiction and mechanics can easily interfere with each other.**

Games are filled with cliche, and mechanics are one of the main reasons. Consider the amnesiac player character. That narrative hook explains why other characters in the game are info dumping on the player.

Consider physical violence. It removes most, if not all of the nuance of human interaction and allows the player to make quick sense of the conflict and relationship. More subtle games, like L.A. Noire, struggled with explaining this to players.

This results in something perilous for games.

**Because fiction and mechanics so easily interfere with each other, many games choose to emphasize one while mostly ignoring the other.**

There's a large debate about where the power and meaning in games comes from. It's game design's nature vs nurture. 

**Ludologists vs Narratologists**
Are mechanics there to hang the important bits (fiction) on? OR is the fiction there just to make the mechanics accessible?

The answer is simple.

**The pinnacle of game design craft is combining perfect mechanics and compelling fiction into one seamless system of meaning**

Fiction and mechanics need not fight, though they easily can, and neither one need be given primacy, though one often is. 

The should be used together, threaded together, to make a singular system of emotion.
