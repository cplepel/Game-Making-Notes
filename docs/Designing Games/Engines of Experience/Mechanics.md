# Mechanics
### Games are composed of Mechanics, which define how the game works.
A mechanic i a rule about how a game works.

*The A button makes Mario jump* is a mechanic.

So are the rules *characters walk at one meter per second, pawns capture diagonally,* and *players alternate taking turns*.

In board games, mechanics are executed ritualistically and learned from a rule book. In video games, mechanics are written into the code.

# Events
### During play, mechanics and players interact to generate Events
An event is something that happens during play. *Mario hits a wall and bounces back, the pawn captures the rook,* and *the ball went in the net* are all events.

This is critical to understand. In every other medium, the events are authored directly either by the screenwriter, novelist, choreographer, etc.

Games are different. We can't author the events directly, but we can author the mecahnics that generate the events we desire.

### Events and Mechanics Example: Super Mario Galaxy

In Super Mario Galaxy, Mario tries to make a jump and misses, landing in lava. His butt bursts into flames and shoots him back into the air, where the player steers him toward a safe landing on the ground.

##### The Events
The events were Mario jumping, missing, hitting the lava, burstingi nto flames, flying into the air, screaming, and maneuvering back to safety.

##### The Mechanics
The mechanics behind these events were the jump button, gravity, physical collision, the explosive-butt lava reaction, and the ability to control mario in the air.

The disc of SMG does not contain the events described, just the mechanics. 


**Game Designers do not design events. We design systems of mechanics that generate events. This layer of indrection is the fundamental difference between games and most other media. It is our greatest opportunity and toughest challenge. This is also why modes of thought from other media so often fail in games.**

## The Primacy of Emotion

**To be meaningful, an event must provoke an emotion.**

**The valuable emotions of play are very subtle. Often, players don't directly notice them.**

**Detecting and understanding subtle emotions is a designer skill.**

These three key points just focus on the fact that games are more like an EKG graph than a a straight emotive line. There are many small ups and downs that give the experience the texture needed to get players into [[Flow]].

**Emotions are not limited to "fun" for games**
This seems obvious, but the goal cannot just be fun.

### Emotional Triggers
**Your unconscious mind is always analyzing your situation. When certain conditions are met, the unconscious triggers an emotional response.**

**An EMOTIONAL TRIGGER is some thing or observation that causes emotion.**



### Emotional Change
To trigger emotion, an event must cause meaningful change in the world. But not just any change will do.

**To provoke an emotion, an event must change some HUMAN VALUE**

The defintion of this is simple.
**A HUMAN VALUE is a value that is important to people that can shift through multiple states**

The simplest example is an asteroid strike. An asteroid striking a distant planet is an astronomical curiosity. An asteroid striking the Earth is a wretched, awful event. See?

Some examples of human values are: life/death, victory/defeat, friend/stranger/enemy, wealth/poverty, low status/high status, together/alone.

These state changes need not be limited to only in game. Think of gambling or casino games.

**Whats emotional relevant is not the event itself, but the changes in human values implied by that event. The more important the human value and the more it changes, the greater the emotion.**

**Emotions don't just happen in response to change. They also happen in anticipation of change.**

Consider having 9 out of 10 kills in a killstreak in MW2.

**A reveal of information is emotionally equivalent to change.**

### The Emotional Black Box
Emotion is the goal of game design, but it is a challenge,b ecause it's hard to track the precise origins of our emotions.

**We can't direectly perceive the logic behind our emotional triggers.**

Look up the 1973 bridge study. Basically, a heightened mental state of fear was misnterpreted as attraction to a woman surveyor.
