# Flow

## Flow is a state of concentration so focused that it amounts to total absorption in an activity.

Flow makes time disappear. Hours can seem like minutes when yo uare utterly engrossed in the activity.

#### Flow appears when a player is presented with a challenge that is perfectly balanced against his ability level. 
If the task is too hard, flow breaks, and the player becomes confused and anxious. If it's too easy, they get bored.

## Nearly all games have to maintain Flow to work.
