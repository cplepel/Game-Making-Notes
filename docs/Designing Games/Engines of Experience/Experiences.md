# Experiences

**An experience is an arc of emotions, thoughts, and decisions inside the player's mind.**

#### Pure Emotion
We can maximize a single feeling by combining several different emotional triggers that drive the exact same emotion. Each trigger is like another booster rocket that pushes the experience further toward one pure emotional peak.
#### Juxtaposition
Juxtaposition is the combination of different, seemingly incompatible feelings. Ramming together feelings that don't ordinarily mix can produce strange and sometimes valuable results.
#### Antagonistic Emotions
Ice cream and pizza are both great, but they're not so great together. In the same way, some emotions don't work together because they're antagonistic to each other.
#### Atmosphere
I mean this is just the game's atmosphere
#### Emotional Variation
Any single emotion gets tiring if sustained too long. To retain power and freshness, an experience must transform over time.

One classic way is *pacing variation*. This is seen everywhere and has been studied forever by classic storytellers. 

This leads to [[Flow]].
