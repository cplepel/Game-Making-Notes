# Games are Engines of Experience

## Games are comprised of [[Mechanics]]

## [[Mechanics]] are then wrapped in [[The Fiction Layer]]

## Together, they craft [[Experiences]] for the player.

## Those [[Experiences]] lead to [[Immersion]]

This leads to Tynan's THESIS.

# To create an experience that mirrors that of a character, we construct it out of three parts. First, we create [[Flow]] to strip the real world out of the player's mind. Second, we create an arousal state using threats and challenges in the game mechanics. Finally, we use [[The Fiction Layer]] to label the player's arousal state to match the character's feelings.

If we break this down.
First: Flow is first to be created and is created entirely by mechanics. We need flow to strip away real life. It's a prerequisite for immersion.

Second: Arousal. This can also be done exclusively through mechanics, see Geometry Wars.

Finally: Fiction. We must label the arousal generated by the mechanics.

# A Game is an artificial system for creating experiences.
